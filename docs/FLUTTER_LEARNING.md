### Code Style
- Follow [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart)
- Use `dart format` for consistent code formatting
- Follow the [Flutter Style Guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo)

### Performance
- Use `const` constructors
- Minimize widget rebuilds
- Use `ListView.builder` for long lists
- Optimize image assets

### Security
- Never store sensitive data in code
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Validate all user input
- Keep dependencies updated

## Project Setup Recommendations

### VS Code Extensions
- Flutter
- Dart
- Awesome Flutter Snippets
- Pubspec Assist
- Bloc
- Riverpod Snippets

### Android Studio/IntelliJ Plugins
- Flutter
- Dart
- Flutter Intl
- JSON to Dart Model
- Flutter Riverpod Snippets

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

1. **State Management**
   - Problem: Unnecessary widget rebuilds
   - Solution: Use `Provider` or `Riverpod` with `Consumer`

2. **Performance Issues**
   - Problem: Janky animations
   - Solution: Use `RepaintBoundary` and optimize build methods

3. **Memory Leaks**
   - Problem: Memory usage grows over time
   - Solution: Dispose controllers and subscriptions

4. **Platform-Specific Issues**
   - Problem: Different behavior on iOS/Android
   - Solution: Use `Platform` class and test on both platforms
